#' Fuse affinity networks (i.e., matrices) through one-step or two-step random walk
#'
#' @param Wall a list of affinity matrices of the same shape.
#' @param K the number of k nearest neighbors for function kNN_graph
#' @param weight a list of non-negative real numbers (which will be 
#' normalized internally so that it sums to 1) that one-to-one correspond to 
#' the affinity matrices included in `Wall`. If not set, internally uniform weights 
#' are assigned to all affinity matrices in `Wall`.
#' @param type choose one of the two options: perform "one-step" random walk, 
#' or "two-step" random walk on the list of affinity matrices in `Wall`` to 
#' generate a fused affinity matrix. Default: "two-step" random walk
#' @param alpha a list of eight non-negative real numbers (which will be normalized
#' internally to make it sums to 1). Only used when "two-step" (default value 
#' of `type`) random walk is used. `alpha` is the weights for eight terms in the 
#' "two-step" random walk formula (check research paper for more explanations about 
#' the terms). Default value: (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), i.e., only use the 
#' first two terms (since they are most effective in practice).
