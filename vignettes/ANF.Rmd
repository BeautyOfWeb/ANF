abstract: Cancer genomics projects have generated tons of multi-omic data. Integrating multi-omic data for patient clustering and cancer subtyping is an important and challenging task. Based a popular method, Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), we present Affinity Network Fusion (ANF) that have several advantages over SNF. The package ANF provides methods for affinity matrix construction and fusion as well as spectral clustering. This vignette explains the basic usage of the package.

# Basic usage of ANF package (demonstration with synthetic data)

In the following, let's first generate a synthetic dataset and use it for demonstrating the basic usage of ANF.

For complex objects (e.g., patients) with multi-view data, we can use a feature matrix representing each view. For example, gene expression matrix and miRNA expression matrix can represent two views of patients.

In the following, rows of a feature matrix represent objects, and columns represent features. Note each feature matrix contains a number of features from a feature space (corresponding one view). We can concatenate all features together as we will experiment later. However, since features from different feature spaces are usually heterogeneous, it may be a good idea to analyze them in its own feature space first, and then combine the results later. This is basically how ANF works.

### Generating the first view (feature matrix) of 200 samples
For simplicity, let's generate the first view (matrix `feature1`) of 200 samples: 100 samples for class 1 (the first 100 rows of matrix `feature1`), and 100 samples for class 2 (the last 100 rows of matrix `feature1`), using multi-variate Gaussian distribution.
```{r}
library(MASS)
true.class = rep(c(1,2),each=100)
feature.mat1 = mvrnorm(100, rep(0, 20), diag(runif(20,0.2,2)))
feature.mat2 = mvrnorm(100, rep(0.5, 20), diag(runif(20,0.2,2)))
feature1 = rbind(feature.mat1, feature.mat2)
```

### KMeans and spectral clustering based on only the first view
Let's perform KMeans clustering. The Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is only 0.26.
```{r}
library(igraph)
set.seed(1)
km = kmeans(feature1, 2)
compare(km$cluster, true.class, method='nmi')
```

Let's perform spectral clustering using functions in ANF package. The NMI is 0.29, slightly higher than KMeans.
```{r}
library(ANF)
d = dist(feature1)
d = as.matrix(d)
A1 = affinity_matrix(d, 10)
labels = spectral_clustering(A1, 2)
compare(labels, true.class, method='nmi')
```

### Generating the second view (feature matrix) for the above 200 samples
Similar to the first view, we can generate a second view (matrix `feature2`). The rows of `feature1` and `feature2` have one-to-one correspondence. 
```{r}
feature.mat1 = mvrnorm(100, rep(10, 30), diag(runif(30,0.2,3)))
feature.mat2 = mvrnorm(100, rep(9.5, 30), diag(runif(30,0.2,3)))
feature2 = rbind(feature.mat1, feature.mat2)
```

### KMeans and spectral clustering based on only the second view
Similarly, the NMI of KMeans clustering and spectral clustering are 0.14 (can be different because of random initialization) and 0.19 respectively.
```{r}
set.seed(123)
km = kmeans(feature2, 2)
compare(km$cluster, true.class, method='nmi')

d = dist(feature2)
d = as.matrix(d)
A2 = affinity_matrix(d, 10)
labels = spectral_clustering(A2, 2)
compare(labels, true.class, method='nmi')
```

### Concatenate all features from two views and perform KMeans clustering (NMI = 0.58)
```{r}
feature.cat = cbind(feature1, feature2)
set.seed(1)
km = kmeans(feature.cat, 2)
compare(km$cluster, true.class, method='nmi')
```

### Use ANF for clustering (NMI = 0.76)
ANF performs better than KMeans on concatenated features
```{r}
W = ANF(list(A1, A2), K=30)
labels = spectral_clustering(W,2)
compare(labels, true.class, method='nmi')
```


# Apply ANF to harmonized TCGA dataset

## Load data 
`HarmonizedTCGAData` package (https://github.com/BeautyOfWeb/HarmonizedTCGAData) contains three R objects: `Wall`, `project_ids` and `surv.plot`:

`Wall` contains a complex list affinity matrices. In fact, `Wall` a list (five cancer type) of list (six feature normalization types: `raw.all`, `raw.sel`, `log.all`, `log.sel`,  `vst.sel`, `normalized`) of list (three feature spaces or views: `fpkm`, `mirna`, and `methy450`) of matrices. The rownames of each matrix are case IDs (i.e., patient IDs), and the column names of each matrix are aliquot IDs (which contains case IDs as prefix). 

`project_ids` is a named character vector that maps the case_id (represent a patient) to project_id (one-to-one corresponds to disease type). This is used for evaluating clustering results, such as calculating Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI).

`surv.plot` is a data.frame containing patient survival data for survival analysis, providing an "indirect" way to evaluate clustering results.

`HarmonizedTCGAData` package contains more details about the above three data objects and simple examples of how to use them. We suggest users to read the vignettes of `HarmonizedTCGAData` first since it covers easier examples of using `ANF` and `HarmonizedTCGAData` packages. 

In the following, we are majorly focusing on reproducing the results of the companion paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07136 The code below may be a little harder to follow than simply using `ANF` package.

```{r}
library(ExperimentHub)
eh <- ExperimentHub()
myfiles <- query(eh, "HarmonizedTCGAData")
Wall <- myfiles[[1]]
project_ids <- myfiles[[2]]
surv.plot <- myfiles[[3]]

# A simple example of how to use `ANF` (more details are in HarmonizedTCGAData package)
fused.mat <- ANF(Wall = Wall$adrenal_gland$raw.all)
res <- eval_clu(true_class = project_ids[rownames(fused.mat)], w = fused.mat, surv = surv.plot, verbose = TRUE)
```


## Reproduce results of companion paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07136
The code below is not directly relevant to using functions in this package, but for the purpose of reproduction research. Users can skip this part. This part will take more than 10 minutes to run. We set `eval=FALSE` in code blocks below.

### Use ANF generate fused affinity matrices
Let's use ANF to generate fused affinity matrices for clustering these five cancer types into their own disease types. Except kidney cancer, which has three disease types, all four other cancer types each have two disease types. 
Since we have three view (i.e., gene expression, miRNA expression and DNA methylation), there are seven combinations.
```{r}
cancer_types = names(Wall)
feature_types = names(Wall[[1]])
data_types = names(Wall[[1]][[1]])

tmp = lapply(1:length(data_types), function(i) combn(data_types, i))
data_types_combn = list()
for (i in tmp){
    for(j in 1:ncol(i)){
        data_types_combn[[paste(i[,j],collapse = ".")]] = i[,j]
    }
}
data_types_combn
```

We can run ANF for all 210 possible combinations (i.e., five cancer_types, six feature normalization measures, and seven data combinations) using three `for` loops below, and store the results ("NMI", "ARI" and "-log10(pvalue)") in `res.ANF` (for plotting figures later), and store the fused affinity matrices in `Ws.ANF`. Note this takes at least several minutes.
```{r}
library(survival)
Ws.ANF = list()
res.ANF = list()
for (cancer_type in cancer_types) {
    for (feature_type in feature_types) {
        for (data_type in names(data_types_combn)) {
            message(paste(cancer_type, feature_type, data_type))
            # Using ANF to fuse a list of affinity matrices
            W = ANF(Wall[[cancer_type]][[feature_type]][data_types_combn[[data_type]]], K=15)
            # Evaluate clustering result
            clu.res = eval_clu(project_ids, w=W, surv = surv.plot)
            # Save fused affinity matrix
            Ws.ANF[[cancer_type]][[feature_type]][[data_type]] = W
            # Save "NMI", "ARI", and "-log10(pvalue)"
            res.ANF[[cancer_type]][[feature_type]][[data_type]] = clu.res$clu.res
        }
    }
}
```


### p-value of log rank test of survival distributions alone is not sufficient for evaluating cluster quality
Our experiment results show that p-value of log-rank test of survival distributions of different disease types should not be used as the single metric to evaluate cancer patient clustering results. 

It is not always the case that the p-value of log-rank test of survival distribution of patient groups assigned using true disease type information is the smallest. In fact, when we use groundtruth class labels for survival analysis, the p-values for lung and colerectal cancer (both have two disease types) do not reach statistical levels at all.
```{r}
# sample_list will store a list of named characters corresponding to case_ids in each cancer type
sample_list = list()
logpval_trueclass = list()
for (cancer_type in cancer_types){
    sample_list[[cancer_type]] = rownames(Ws.ANF[[cancer_type]][[1]][[1]])
    # project_ids contains disease type information 
    labels = as.factor(project_ids[sample_list[[cancer_type]]])
    surv = surv.plot[sample_list[[cancer_type]],]
    f = Surv(surv$time, !surv$censored)
    fit = survdiff(f~labels)
    pval = pchisq(fit$chisq, df=length(fit$n)-1, lower.tail = FALSE)
    message(cancer_type)
    message(-log10(pval))
    logpval_trueclass[[cancer_type]] = -log10(pval)
}
# logpval_trueclass is a numeric vector of five numbers, i.e., -log10(pval) for survival analysis using true disease label information. (Used for plotting figures later)
logpval_trueclass = unlist(logpval_trueclass)
```


Now we have `res.ANF` which is a complex list. It is very hard to plot `res.ANF` in one figure since it contains multiple aspects of results. Instead, we will choose different "viewpoints" of `res.ANF` to to draw figures to demonstrate the power of ANF and feature engineering in the following.

### Demonstate the power of ANF 
Now let's examine the power of ANF. First let's rearrange `res.ANF` into `power.anf` that is easier to use for plotting figures in this section.
```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
metric_names = c("NMI", "ARI", "-log10(p)")
power.anf = list()
res = res.ANF
for (idx_feature in seq_len(length(feature_types))) {
    for (idx_metric in seq_len(length(metric_names))) {
        xtab = array(unlist(res), dim=c(length(res[[1]][[1]][[1]]), length(res[[1]][[1]]), length(res[[1]]), length(res)), dimnames = list(metric_names, names(res[[1]][[1]]), names(res[[1]]), names(res)))
        
        power.anf[[feature_types[idx_feature]]][[metric_names[idx_metric]]] = xtab[idx_metric, names(res[[1]][[1]]), idx_feature, cancer_types]
    }
}
```

Plot figures and save them in folder "./figs/power_of_ANF/".
```{r}
# Did not show colorectal cancer, since all possible clustering does not achieve a good NMI or ARI. Presumbly for colorectal cancer, the two disease types cannot be separated by gene and miRNA expression and DNA methylation data. Survival analysis also show no significant difference between the two disease types.
# Excluding colorectal cancer index (i.e., 5)
idx_cancer = c(1,2,4,3)

if(!dir.exists("./figs/power_of_ANF/")) {
    dir.create("./figs/power_of_ANF/", recursive = TRUE)
}
figfolder = "./figs/power_of_ANF/"

for (idx_feature in seq_len(length(feature_types))) {
    for (idx_metric in seq_len(length(metric_names))) {
        metric = power.anf[[idx_feature]][[idx_metric]][,idx_cancer]
        rownames(metric) = c("gene", "mirnas", "methylation", "gene+mirnas","gene+methylation","mirnas+methylation","gene+mirnas+methylation")
        if (idx_metric!=3) {
            # Plot figures for metric "NMI" and "ARI"
            png(filename = paste0(figfolder,"power_ANF_", feature_types[idx_feature], "_", metric_names[idx_metric],".png"), height = 900, width = 1600, res = 150)
            barplot(metric, beside = TRUE, col = brewer.pal(nrow(metric), "Set1"), legend.text = TRUE, xlim=c(0,40), ylim = c(0,1),args.legend = list(x = 35, y=1.1,bty = "n"), ylab = metric_names[idx_metric], main = paste("FeatureType:", feature_types[idx_feature]))
            dev.off()
        } else {
            # Plot figures for metric "-log10(p-value)"
            # Add one bar "TrueClass" for each cancer type
            neg_log_p = rbind(metric, logpval_trueclass[colnames(metric)])
            rownames(neg_log_p)[nrow(neg_log_p)] = "TrueClass"
            png(filename = paste0(figfolder,"power_ANF_", feature_types[idx_feature], "_pval.png"), height = 900, width = 1600, res = 150)
            barplot(neg_log_p, beside = TRUE, col = brewer.pal(nrow(neg_log_p), "Set1"), legend.text = TRUE, xlim=c(0,40), ylim=c(0,13), args.legend = list(x = 17,y=14,bty = "n"), ylab = metric_names[idx_metric], main = paste("FeatureType:", feature_types[idx_feature]))
            dev.off()
        }
    }
}
```


### Demonstate the power of feature engineering
Again let's first rearrange `res.ANF` to `power.feature` for plotting purpose.
```{r}
res = res.ANF
cancer_types = names(res)
feature_types = names(res[[1]])
data_types = names(res[[1]][[1]])
metric_names = c("NMI", "ARI", "-log10(p)")

power.feature = list()
idx_views = c(1,2,4)
view_names = c("gene expression", "miRNA expression", "gene+miRNA")
for (idx_view in idx_views) {
    for (idx_metric in 1:length(metric_names)) {
        xtab = array(unlist(res), dim=c(length(res[[1]][[1]][[1]]), length(res[[1]][[1]]), length(res[[1]]), length(res)), dimnames = list(metric_names, names(res[[1]][[1]]), names(res[[1]]), names(res)))
        power.feature[[data_types[idx_view]]][[metric_names[idx_metric]]] = xtab[idx_metric, idx_view, feature_types, cancer_types]
    }
}
```


Plot and then save figures in "./figs/power_of_FeatureEngineering".
```{r}
# Again we exclude colorectal cancer (index: 5) in the figures
idx_cancers = c(1,2,4,3)
# reorder the indexes this way so that it is consistent with the figures shown in the companion paper
idx_features = c(1,6,2:5)
if(!dir.exists("./figs/power_of_FeatureEngineering/")) {
    dir.create("./figs/power_of_FeatureEngineering/", recursive = TRUE)
}
figfolder = "./figs/power_of_FeatureEngineering/"

for (idx_view in 1:length(idx_views)) {
    for (idx_metric in 1:length(metric_names)) {
        metric = power.feature[[idx_view]][[idx_metric]][idx_features,idx_cancers]
        if (idx_metric!=3) {
            # Plot figures for "NMI" and "ARI"
            png(filename = paste0(figfolder,"power_feature_", data_types[idx_views[idx_view]], "_", metric_names[idx_metric],".png"), height = 900, width = 1600, res = 150)
            barplot(metric, beside = TRUE, col = brewer.pal(nrow(metric), "Set1"), legend.text = TRUE, xlim=c(0,30), ylim=c(0,1), args.legend = list(x=30,y=1, bty = "n"), ylab = metric_names[idx_metric], main = paste("DataType(s):", view_names[idx_view]))
            dev.off()
        } else {
            # Plot figures for "-log10(p-value)"
            neg_log_p = rbind(metric, logpval_trueclass[colnames(metric)])
            rownames(neg_log_p)[nrow(neg_log_p)] = "TrueClass"
            png(filename = paste0(figfolder,"power_feature_", data_types[idx_views[idx_view]], "_pval.png"), height = 900, width = 1600, res = 150)
            barplot(neg_log_p, beside = TRUE, col = brewer.pal(nrow(neg_log_p), "Set1"), legend.text = TRUE, xlim=c(0,35),  ylim=c(0,12), args.legend = list(x=20,y=13, bty = "n"), ylab = metric_names[idx_metric], main = paste("DataType(s):", view_names[idx_view]))
            dev.off()
        }
    }
}
```
